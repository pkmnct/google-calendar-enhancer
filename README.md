# google-calendar-enhancer

## Deprecation Notice
Google Calendar [was redesigned](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/time-refresh-introducing-new-look-and-features-google-calendar-web/) in late 2017, and in doing so fixed many things this extension was written for. This extension has now been deprecated as the [new UI was rolled out to all users January 8, 2018](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/01/new-google-calendar-web-ui-to-begin.html).

## About

This Google Chrome extension enhances the appearance and functionality of Google Calendar.

## Motivation

Since Sunrise Calendar has been discontinued, the goal of this project is to make Google Calendar act similarly and look as pretty as Sunrise did.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calender-enhancer/bekbminiphjbepfcpgnfkiokajelgiak).

## Contributors

I would love for anyone to contribute to the extension. I will do what I can as I get free time.
