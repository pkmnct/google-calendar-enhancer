## About

This Google Chrome extension enhances the appearance and functionality of Google Calendar.

## Motivation

Since Sunrise Calendar has been discontinued, the goal of this project is to make Google Calendar act similarly and look as pretty as Sunrise did.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calender-enhancer/bekbminiphjbepfcpgnfkiokajelgiak).

I would love for anyone to contribute to the extension. I will do what I can as I get free time.
